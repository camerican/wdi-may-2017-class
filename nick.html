     <p><strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>â€”Nick has been an actor and writer for what has ostensibly been his entire life. His first book was a children's story entitled <em>The Pig Who Went Bizarre</em> which he wrote at the age of five. There is only one remaining published copy which means it's probably worth millions of dollars by now. Acting was also an early undertaking, landing his first job in a Pampers commercial at eleven months of age. Nick would go on to appear in shows such as <em>Third Watch</em> and movies including <em>Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back</em>. Eventually though, the acting roles began to dry up and Nick's acting career was relegated to improv shows and stand-up gigs in Bridgeport, CT.</p>

     <p>When he realized that the acting thing wasn't going to pan out, Nick realized that catering was a very silly thing for an adult man to subject himself to, and promptly began looking for a new career. Having done a fair amount of freelance design work in the past, Nick knew development would be something he was good at and enjoy doing. So he started studying on his own and eventually signed up for class here at The New York Code And Design Academy. Even though he feels very uncomfortable writing this bio in the third person, Nick is very happy about this decision.</p>

     <p>Nick is happy to say that he has quit his catering job and is looking forward to a career in tech.</p>

     <p>Languages he actively uses in web development include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Javascript (coming soon)</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
       <li>Ruby (coming soon)</li>
      </ul>

     <p>In his free time, Nick enjoys analyzing the minutia of his favorite TV shows, drinking gin, and spending money he doesn't have.</p>
