    <p><strong>Franklin Square, NY</strong> - I'm a current transfer student at the City College of New York, majoring in Computer Science. When it comes to programming, I've been doing it since the 10th grade, learning languages such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PBasic for microcontrollers</li>
        <li>RobotC</li>
        <li>Java for robotics and regular development</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      </ul>
    Though I have some programming experience, I am no where near 'good' at it and know I can and will always learn something new.</p>

    <p>When it comes to past experiences, I've worked in construction, retail, tech support, and as a photobooth attendant. Aside from work, I've completed high school and have only finished my first year of college at NYIT, which I have transfered out of.</p>

    <p>Outside of school and work, I spend most of my little free time gaming, playing guitar, swimming, or reading. I was a competitive swimmer in high school, swimming fly and free for most of the time, but have since then stopped competing. When it comes to gaming, I play tabletop games such as Magic the Gathering or DnD or video games such as League of Legends, Dark Souls, and Final Fantasy.</p>

    <p>In the end, I hope to do well in this class and all others throught my time in school. What I hope to get out of this class is a stronger foundation in my desired major, a way to put myself through college, and just to learn something I'm highly passionate for.</p>
