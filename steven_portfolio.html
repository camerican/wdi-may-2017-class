      <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
      <h3>Robotics</h3>
      <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/edco-production/paperclip/media_assets/1bf755ea-876f-430e-8b0f-d01d94399635/original/img_5801.jpg?1442866549"/>One of my previous projects in the tech field involved my high school robotics team. From 11th grade on, I was part of the team '4017 Robopandas', out of the Sewanhaka Central High School District. For that year, I headed the programming team while also working with the mechanical and financial teams. Over the course of 4 months, my team and I worked daily to design and build a fully functioning robot for the year's game mode; sometimes staying until 6:45 the following morning. With this however, we were able to win multiple competitions, getting to the point where we were able to place 44th out of 128 at World Championships in St. Louis.</p>

      <h3>Instrumentation and Automation</h3>
      <p>In high school, I was also a part of the Instrumentation and Automation program in the school district. The class took place over 3 years, teaching us many different forms of engineering and sciences for the first two years, while ending in an AP Physics C class. Over the first two years, we looked into fields such as computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, and civil engineering. With this, we did multiple projects over the course of the year, the most notable being the construction of a T.E.N.S. unit. The unit acts as a small defibrulator that can be used to stimulate nerves in the arm using a 9V battery.</p>
