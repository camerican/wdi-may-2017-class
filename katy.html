    <p><em><span>New York, NY</span></em>—Katy's projects of note include... absolutely nothing so far.  She took an HTML class in 7th grade (17 years ago... ok, stop counting), in which she made a super awesome website with clouds as the background image (so everyone could tell how cool it was).  She hasn't done any programming since then, but remembers it fondly.  She decided to dust off her very rusty old skills and make them into a shiny new career.</p>

    <p>She earned her bachelors degree in Psychology from UCLA in 2009.  Clearly, it has been very useful... (where's a sarcastic face emoji when you need one?).  She started out with a much nerdier major choice (Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics) but realized she didn't want a career in research (and remembered how much she hated wearing lab goggles).  After college, she worked in merchandising and design (from the retail side, not the tech side), and for the last few years she has done lots of very relevant tech work... as a bartender and server.  She's currently a student at the New York Code + Design Academy, working with other aspiring web delevopers over a 12-week intensive bootcamp to prepare herself for an entirely new career.  She finds this very exciting and definitely not terrifying or panic-inducing.</p>

    <p>Languages she actively uses in web development include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      <li>Yeah, this list is kinda sad right now.  Stay tuned.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In her free time, Katy enjoys reading spy novels, learning how to use a Mac over an all-night series of web tutorials, taking spin classes, and teaching her mother how to use her iphone while carefully leaving out the fact that all iphones have an emoji keyboard (ok, she enjoys the spy novels).  She's passionate about Bay Area sports, especially the Warriors and the Niners (can't win 'em all).
