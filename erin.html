    <h2><strong>Erin Young</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Elkins, WV</strong>— Erin is new to NYC, coding, and development. She has an adventerous and non-linear work history, including but not limited to: singing in an internationally-touring band, managing a college writing center, freelance graphic design and writing, social media and marketing for bands, restaurants, and breweries, performing sketch comedy, and portraying Fairytopia Barbie at a series of Toys-R-Us locations in the mid-00s.  </p>

    <p>Erin has always enjoyed computers and technology, and is mostly self-taught. After spending time working as a graphic designer she believes that learning to code will expand her existing skill set and enable her to offer more services to her clients. </p>

    <p>Outside of her occupational and educational pursuits, Erin enjoys live music, craft beer, and whiskey (particularly when she can partake in all of these interests at the same time). She is a runner who has run 5 full marathons, as well as many half marathons and shorter distance races. Her life is code for the forseeable future. Always about the side hustle, she is currently the grill master at The Gibson in Williamsburg on Saturdays, and if you come by and visit she will make you a killer burger, engage you in some witty repertoire, and recommend a good beer or whiskey that pairs well with both. </p>
