    <p><strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>â€”Hans is an aspiring entrepreneur with a background in sales and marketing, and is dedicated to become a top web developer within the next two years.  </p>

    <p>The reason he switched from sales to web design is because of his attempt to build a website through <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">wix.com</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">squarespace.com</a>, which ended up looking like it was made at the birth of the internet. So after some frustration and then some research, he found this course, which wouldn't only help him design websites, but guide him on towards a career path and gradually towards a career as an entrepreur.</p>

    <p>Something he keeps in mind is that if life is a story, what is your's going to say? And more importantly, who is writing it? </p>

    <p>It is too easy to just go with the flow and follow the crowd. But what is the value of your life if you aren't truly living?</p>
    <p> From what you do day to day, to the craziest adventures in different countries around the world, he wants to look back and remember every single day. Rather than his worst fear of looking back and just seeing a blur of his life flash past without a passionate moment or day.</p>
    

    <p>So any adrenaline filled activities are topping his list of things to do, including whitewater rafting, cliff jumping, and some day soon, sky diving. But to be realistic, in his free time he enjoys barbequing, hiking, and any time of boating ranging from kayaking to sailing.</p>
